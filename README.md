## 🕰️ Legacy System Reference

Original development for this project began in a separate repository:  
🔗 [Legacy Repo – the-shop-inventory-system](https://github.com/ikeyike/the-shop-inventory-system)

It includes early versions of automation scripts and workflow logic that have since been migrated and improved in this version.
